# Britannia Secondary School Capstone Project: StatCALC
StatCALC is a program that calculates discrete probability distributions for users. 

**Disclaimer**
StatCALC is meant to be a practice project for me to learn and apply Java. 
If you would like to help me get better at Java or make recommendations and changes to the code, please make a new branch.

Thanks,
Haad Bhutta
